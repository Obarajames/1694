        Hi, <br>
        Further to my detailed comment on November 28, CIP 1694? seems to focus on leveraging financial stake in Cardano while specifically seeking to avoid or even prevent fiduciary responsibility. Fiduciary responsibility refers to a relationship in which one party (the fiduciary) is responsible for looking after the best interests of another party (the beneficiary). Fiduciary responsibility is a duty of loyalty and impartiality in placing the interests of a corporation, organization or individual first, not allowing decision making to be tainted by self-interest or self-dealing.
        I do not believe that a governance model for Cardano can work without fiduciary obligation. The draft CIP It Takes a Village, for example, seeks to propose a model of government for Cardano that does not aim to introduce a systemic denial or avoidance of fiduciary responsibility into the Cardano ecosystem.
