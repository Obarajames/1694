        <p>I saw an interesting video by army of spies about chat.openai.com. I was <br>inspired by the platforms outcome when asked to write a 4 paragraph <br>academic essay comparing and contrasting the theories of nationalism of<br> Benedit Anderson and Ernest Geller. In 10 seconds a very decent essay <br>popped out.</p>

        <p>
            I think the huge legacy of human endeavour to today contains all the wisdom <br>to construct a very inspiring Constitution.<br>
            If this AI was asked to list the top 12 points for Human prosperity from the <br>Zoroastrian Avesta, The Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata, The Buddhist <br> Tipitaka,, The Bible, The Koran The Tora etc, plus as many Legal rights <br>and Constitutions of the world, US , Magna Carta etc<br>Reinventing the wheel is not required. AI's impartial unbiased, non sectarian <br>and very fast results might give us something very balanced and valuable<br> framework to draw upon.

                I have not yet added anything quite as prescriptive as what you are <br>suggesting, but made a note of the topic in general:<br>

                There are a few interesting things to still think about with respect to this<br> action, and they might have interactions.<br>

        DReps is a role in Project Catalyst already with hundreds of people signed up. I fear that using the same term for this CIP will cause a fair amount of confusion. Is it possible to use a different name so we're not overloading DRep to represent two different roles?

        Please also consider a governance-related CIP draft at an earlier stage of development having far fewer problems at https://change.paradoxicalsphere.com/cip
